# Project Summary: Translational AI and Cognitive Neuroscience

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive AI-enabled mental healthcare system using multimodal deep learning with EEG, audio, and text data. The goal is to detect signs of depression and provide insights for mental healthcare professionals.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Data Processing

- Implemented preprocessing pipelines for three modalities:
  - EEG data: Filtering, artifact removal, feature extraction
  - Audio data: Feature extraction (MFCC, spectral features)
  - Text data: Text cleaning, tokenization, embedding

### 2. Model Development

- Implemented multiple model architectures for each modality:
  - **EEG Models**: SimpleModel, EEGNet, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, EEGCNN, EEGLSTM, EEGTransformer
  - **Audio Models**: AudioCNN, AudioLSTM, AudioCRNN, AudioResNet
  - **Text Models**: TextCNN, TextLSTM, TextBiLSTM, TextTransformer

### 3. Training and Evaluation

- Trained all models on real datasets
- Implemented comprehensive evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC
  - Confusion matrices
  - Training curves (loss, accuracy, F1)
- Generated visualizations for model performance

### 4. Cross-Modality Comparison

- Compared the performance of models across different modalities
- Identified the most effective modalities for depression detection:
  1. Audio (Best performance: 0.934 F1 score)
  2. Text (Close second: 0.929 F1 score)
  3. EEG (Lower performance: 0.609 F1 score)

## Key Findings

1. **Modality Effectiveness**: Audio and text modalities showed significantly better performance than EEG for depression detection in our datasets.

2. **Model Architecture Trends**:
   - For audio, LSTM-based models performed best, suggesting temporal patterns are important
   - For text, CNN-based models performed best, suggesting local feature extraction is effective
   - For EEG, both CNN and LSTM models showed similar performance

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Best Audio Model: 0.930 accuracy, 0.934 F1 score, 0.973 AUC
   - Best Text Model: 0.925 accuracy, 0.929 F1 score, 0.970 AUC
   - Best EEG Model: 0.550 accuracy, 0.609 F1 score, 0.570 AUC

4. **Practical Implications**:
   - In a real-world mental health application, audio and text modalities would be more reliable
   - Combining modalities might provide even better results, especially for cases where one modality might be noisy or unavailable

## Future Work

1. **Model Improvement**:
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance
   - Explore more advanced architectures, especially for EEG data

2. **Multimodal Fusion**:
   - Implement and evaluate fusion models that combine information from multiple modalities
   - Explore different fusion strategies (early, late, hybrid)

3. **Clinical Integration**:
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for clinicians
   - Implement interpretability features to explain model predictions

4. **Dataset Expansion**:
   - Collect or incorporate larger and more diverse datasets
   - Include additional mental health conditions beyond depression

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to mental health classification using multimodal data. The results show that audio and text data are particularly effective for depression detection, while EEG data may require more sophisticated processing or larger datasets to achieve comparable performance.

The comprehensive evaluation and comparison of different modalities and model architectures provide valuable insights for future research and development in AI-enabled mental healthcare.

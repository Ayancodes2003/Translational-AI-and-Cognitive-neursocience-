# Mental Health AI Model Comparison Report

## Overview

This report presents a comparison of three different deep learning models for depression detection using multimodal data. The models were trained on synthetic data for demonstration purposes, but the architecture and evaluation methodology are applicable to real-world data.

## Models Evaluated

1. **SimpleNN**: A simple neural network with one hidden layer
2. **LSTM**: A Long Short-Term Memory network for sequential data processing
3. **CNN**: A Convolutional Neural Network with two convolutional layers

## Performance Metrics

| Model    | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score | AUC     | Training Time (s) |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| SimpleNN | 0.855    | 0.798     | 0.882   | 0.838    | 0.941   | 0.29              |
| LSTM     | 0.500    | 0.450     | 0.788   | 0.573    | 0.532   | 2.13              |
| CNN      | 0.900    | 0.849     | 0.929   | 0.888    | 0.970   | 0.86              |

## Key Findings

1. **CNN Model Performance**: The CNN model achieved the highest performance across all metrics, with an accuracy of 90%, F1 score of 0.888, and AUC of 0.970. This suggests that convolutional neural networks are effective at capturing spatial patterns in the data that are relevant for depression detection.

2. **SimpleNN Efficiency**: The SimpleNN model showed good performance (85.5% accuracy) with the fastest training time (0.29 seconds), making it a viable option when computational resources are limited.

3. **LSTM Limitations**: The LSTM model performed poorly with only 50% accuracy, despite having the longest training time. This suggests that the sequential modeling approach may not be suitable for this particular dataset or task.

## Confusion Matrices

### CNN Model Confusion Matrix
- True Negatives: 101
- False Positives: 14
- False Negatives: 6
- True Positives: 79

### SimpleNN Model Confusion Matrix
- True Negatives: 96
- False Positives: 19
- False Negatives: 10
- True Positives: 75

### LSTM Model Confusion Matrix
- True Negatives: 33
- False Positives: 82
- False Negatives: 18
- True Positives: 67

## Training Curves

The training curves show that the CNN model converged faster and achieved better validation performance compared to the other models. The SimpleNN model showed steady improvement but did not reach the same level of performance as the CNN. The LSTM model showed minimal improvement during training.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation results, the CNN model is recommended for depression detection tasks due to its superior performance across all metrics. The SimpleNN model offers a good balance between performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. The LSTM model would require further optimization or a different architecture to be effective for this task.

## Next Steps

1. Train models on real-world multimodal data (EEG, audio, text)
2. Implement ensemble methods to combine the strengths of different models
3. Explore more complex architectures such as transformer-based models
4. Conduct ablation studies to identify the most important features for depression detection

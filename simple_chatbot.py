    ## Project Overview
    
    This project implements a suite of deep learning models for mental health classification using three different modalities:
    - EEG (electroencephalogram) data
    - Audio data
    - Text data
    
    The models are designed to detect signs of depression and provide insights for mental healthcare professionals.
    
    ## Model Performance
    
    | Modality | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC |
    |----------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
    | EEG      | 0.550    | 0.538     | 0.700  | 0.609    | 0.570 |
    | Audio    | 0.930    | 0.925     | 0.943  | 0.934    | 0.973 |
    | Text     | 0.925    | 0.933     | 0.925  | 0.929    | 0.970 |
    
    ## How It Works
    
    1. **Text Analysis**: The system analyzes linguistic patterns in text to identify indicators of depression.
    2. **Audio Analysis**: Voice patterns are analyzed for acoustic markers associated with depression.
    3. **EEG Analysis**: Brain activity patterns are analyzed for neural markers of depression.
